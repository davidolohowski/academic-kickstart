#### My name

My Chinese name is 李大一， 李 (Li, don't think there's any issue with how to pronounce it) is the family name; 大一 (Dah Yee) is my first name. Quite ironically, the literal translation of my first name is "Big One" while I am no where near anything big (although my head might be). My name doesn't carry the meaning of its literal translation, and I don't know what it really means --- my dad does not want to tell me.

#### Hobbies

I draw and doodle in my spare time. I play video games a lot, sometimes probably too much (Black Myth: Wukong is too good). I love Star Wars (original, prequel, Mandalorian, Rogue One, etc.), LOTR, Harry Potter.

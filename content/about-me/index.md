#### My name

My Chinese name is 李大一， 李 (Li, don't think there's any issue with how to pronounce it) is the family name; 大一 (Dah Yee) is my first name. Quite ironically, the literal translation of my first name is "Big One" while I am no where near anything big (although my head may have an above average size). Certainly, it doesn't carry the meaning of its literal translation, but I don't know what it really means since my dad is still not willing to tell me.

#### Hobbies

I draw and doodle in my spare time. In fact, I was aiming for a career as an artist all the way till high school. But I dropped it as a career path due to multiple reasons and it ended up as a hobby after high school. It still provides me with a lot of calm and comfort, however, and I enjoy the absolute freedom when I let my imagination loose. 

I am also a die-hard of the GOAT --- Lionel Messi. The debate on whether he is the GOAT has already settled after the 2022 WC.

I also quite enjoy classical musics as well as movie scores when I need to focus and study. Debussy and Mozart are probably on the top of my list. Interstellar and Star Wars soundtracks are simply genius.

I am also an avid fantasy/sci-fi fan. It might be cliche, but Star Wars, LOTR and Harry Potter can always make me go on and on.

I am a Ph.D. student in statistics advised by <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html" target="_blank">Gwen Eadie</a>, <a href="http://pbrown.ca/" target="_blank">Patrick Brown</a>,  and <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~abraham/Web/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Roberto Abraham</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>. I am a <a href="https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/?page_id=1091" target="_blank">CANSSI Ontario Multidisciplinary Doctoral (Mdoc) trainee</a> in statistics and astronomy. My research interests lie in the emerging new field of astrostatistics as well as spatial statistics and Bayesian computation. My Ph.D. work will be mainly focusing on developing novel methodology in spatial statistcs to address problems regarding the distributional properties of various astronomical objects. Currently, the objects under consideration are ultra-diffuse galaxies.

Before coming to UofT, I obtained my bachelor degree in financial modelling in 2018 at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Western University</a>. Subsequently, I obtained my Masters degree in statistics in 2020 at Western University under the supervision of <a href="http://fisher.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/aim/" target="_blank">Ian McLeod</a> and <a href="http://www.physics.uwo.ca/people/faculty_web_pages/barmby.html" target="_blank">Pauline Barmby</a> where I worked on spatial point process modelling of stellar objects in the M33 galaxy. I also worked a little bit on faciliating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for certain models with intractable likelihood functions.

In general, I believe there is still an inadequacy of rigorous applications of advanced statistical methods in astronomy. Filling this inadequacy can bring about new understanding and discovery in astronomy and help us better understand the origin of the Universe. Therefore, I am interested in pushing proper statistical application in astronomy as well as developing new statistical methods to tackle challenging astronomical questions.

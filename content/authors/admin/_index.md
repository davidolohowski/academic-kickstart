I am a Ph.D. Candidate in statistics advised by <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html" target="_blank">Gwen Eadie</a>, <a href="http://pbrown.ca/" target="_blank">Patrick Brown</a>,  and <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~abraham/Web/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Roberto Abraham</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>. I am a <a href="https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/?page_id=1091" target="_blank">CANSSI Ontario Multidisciplinary Doctoral (Mdoc) trainee</a> and a <a href="https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/doctoral-student-fellowship/" target="_blank">Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Fellow</a>. My research interests lie in the emerging new field of astrostatistics as well as spatial statistics and Bayesian computation. My Ph.D. work focuses on developing novel methodology in spatial statistcs to better understand the mysterious ultra-diffuse galaxies.

Before coming to UofT, I obtained my bachelor degree in financial modelling in 2018 at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Western University</a>. Subsequently, I obtained my Masters degree in statistics in 2020 at Western University under the supervision of <a href="http://fisher.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/aim/" target="_blank">Ian McLeod</a> and <a href="http://www.physics.uwo.ca/people/faculty_web_pages/barmby.html" target="_blank">Pauline Barmby</a>.

In general, I believe there is still an inadequacy of rigorous applications of advanced statistical methods in astronomy. Filling this inadequacy can bring about new understanding and discovery in astronomy and help us better understand the Universe. Hence, I am interested in novel statistical application in astronomy as well as developing new statistical methods to tackle challenging astronomical questions.

abstract: We demonstrate the power of spatial statistical modelling when applied to stellar population studies. Using Gibbs point process (GPP) models in the spatial statistics literature, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the empirical spatial distributions of the stellar objects in M33, including CO filament, giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and young stellar clusters (YSCs). We choose a hierarchical model structure to characterize the spatial relations between CO filament, GMCs and YSCs. Bayesian inference is employed and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for GPP models are introduced. This work is a novel contribution compared to the current methodology employed where only a limited, empirical two-point correlation function (2PCF) analysis is conducted. Through this modelling approach, we account for the inhomogeneity present in the distribution of stellar objects as well as the effects of objects' properties on their spatial distributions. We confirm that the distribution of GMCs and YSCs are highly correlated and we found that the spatial distributions of GMCs and YSCs are clustered at approximately 200 to 500 pc scale compared to a Poisson process. Furthermore, the distance from GMCs to the galaxy center and the gas mass of GMCs have a strong positive effect on the number density of YSCs.
